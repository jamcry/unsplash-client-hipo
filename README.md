## Installation & Usage

For bash environment, you can temporarily store your keys as follows:
```bash
export $UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY="<YOUR UNSPLASH API ACCESS KEY HERE>"
export $REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY HERE>"
```

üöÄ After cloning this repo and making sure you are in the project directory, install the dependencies and run the app via package manager  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install && npm start
